# Miscellaneous-Web-Projects
A collection of miscellaneous web projects I have worked on. 
Not meant to be anything serious. 
Just me playing around with different aspects of web development
They aren't commented.
I didn't practice very good development practices.
They are just different things that I made quickly to either play with 
or explore some aspect of web development.
